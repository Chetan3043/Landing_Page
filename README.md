🖋️ Description:

This project is a modern, fully responsive dark-mode landing page designed using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript). It showcases advanced UI techniques such as glassmorphism, sticky headers, and responsive navigation menus with a pure-CSS hamburger toggle for small screens.
The page is structured into key sections — Header, Hero, Features, and Footer — and adapts gracefully across all breakpoints (from <576px to ≥1400px). It demonstrates strong design aesthetics with smooth transitions, scalable typography, and optimized spacing for every screen size.
